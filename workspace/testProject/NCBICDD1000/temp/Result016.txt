cd10234, HSPA9-Ssq1-like_NBD, Nucleotide-binding domain of human HSPA9 and similar proteins.  This subfamily includes human mitochondrial HSPA9 (also known as 70-kDa heat shock protein 9, CSA; MOT; MOT2; GRP75; PBP74; GRP-75; HSPA9B; MTHSP75; the gene encoding HSPA9 maps to 5q31.1), Escherichia coli DnaK, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Stress-seventy subfamily Q protein 1/Ssq1p (also called Ssc2p, Ssh1p, mtHSP70 homolog), and S. cerevisiae Stress-Seventy subfamily C/Ssc1p (also called mtHSP70, Endonuclease SceI 75 kDa subunit). It belongs to the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) family of chaperones that assist in protein folding and assembly, and can direct incompetent "client" proteins towards degradation. Typically, HSP70s have a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and a substrate-binding domain (SBD). The nucleotide sits in a deep cleft formed between the two lobes of the NBD. The two subdomains of each lobe change conformation between ATP-bound, ADP-bound, and nucleotide-free states. ATP binding opens up the substrate-binding site; substrate-binding increases the rate of ATP hydrolysis. Hsp70 chaperone activity is regulated by various co-chaperones: J-domain proteins and nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs); for Escherichia coli DnaK, these are the DnaJ and GrpE, respectively.	2.84e-162	674768	673797
