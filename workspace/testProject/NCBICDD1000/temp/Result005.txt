pfam15782, GREB1, Gene regulated by oestrogen in breast cancer.  GREB1 (gene regulated by estrogen in breast cancer 1) was first identified as an oestrogen-regulated gene expressed in breast cancer. Its exact function is not known but its expression is regulated by the coordinated binding of oestrogen-receptors to distal sites interacting with Pol II to activate gene transcription from core promoters located at a considerable distance from the greb1 gene.	3.39e-04	284256	283606
