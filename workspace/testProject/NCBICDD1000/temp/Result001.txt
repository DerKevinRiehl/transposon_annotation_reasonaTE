cd01650, RT_nLTR_like, RT_nLTR: Non-LTR (long terminal repeat) retrotransposon and non-LTR retrovirus reverse transcriptase (RT). This subfamily contains both non-LTR retrotransposons and non-LTR retrovirus RTs. RTs catalyze the conversion of single-stranded RNA into double-stranded DNA for integration into host chromosomes. RT is a multifunctional enzyme with RNA-directed DNA polymerase, DNA directed DNA polymerase and ribonuclease hybrid (RNase H) activities.	7.55e-49	116408	117151

pfam00078, RVT_1, Reverse transcriptase (RNA-dependent DNA polymerase).  A reverse transcriptase gene is usually indicative of a mobile element such as a retrotransposon or retrovirus. Reverse transcriptases occur in a variety of mobile elements, including retrotransposons, retroviruses, group II introns, bacterial msDNAs, hepadnaviruses, and caulimoviruses.	4.84e-24	116423	117064

pfam17921, Integrase_H2C2, Integrase zinc binding domain.  This zinc binding domain is found in a wide variety of integrase proteins.	2.92e-08	148232	148065
pfam00665, rve, Integrase core domain.  Integrase mediates integration of a DNA copy of the viral genome into the host chromosome. Integrase is composed of three domains. The amino-terminal domain is a zinc binding domain pfam02022. This domain is the central catalytic domain. The carboxyl terminal domain that is a non-specific DNA binding domain pfam00552. The catalytic domain acts as an endonuclease when two nucleotides are removed from the 3' ends of the blunt-ended viral DNA made by reverse transcription. This domain also catalyzes the DNA strand transfer reaction of the 3' ends of the viral DNA to the 5' ends of the integration site.	2.71e-04	147720	147601

cd00303, retropepsin_like, Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases.  The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	0.002	150947	150759
